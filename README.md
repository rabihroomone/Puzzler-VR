Puzzler Project Plan PhasePuzzler UI SketchesUser Testing
User testing is a major part of game design and development process. Below are some user testing cases done for Puzzler project.
User TestingUser Testing : Scale and Game Mood
The first test was to check whether the scale of the game was appropriate and to get a feed back about the first game setup.
Size of the dungeon?

Tester: a little big in size, the dungeon seems big regarding to my scale.
Action: Scale the dungeon until it was accepted
2. Mood of the game?
Tester: The environment seems real except for the lights which looks very static and unreal.
Lights need to give more real fealAction: Replaced lights with flame particle system that gave a real lightning feel.
User Testing : UI
This testing was made after applying UI to puzzler project.
UI Clear text?

Tester: The UI text is clear
2. UI Size and position?
Tester: The UI size is big and seems close to my face.
Action: Resize and re position the UI to be more comfortable for the user.
User Testing: Game Play
This testing phase had multiple refinement after user feedback. It included feedback about movement and if there was any sickness during play. Also how the game play feels and if they enjoyed it.
The feedback was that the game play was good and the environment looks reel. 
When the user failed to solve the puzzle, only failed sound was played and the user did not know what to do. I solved this issue by adding a faded UI Text feedback telling the user that he failed and should try again.
Failed to solve the puzzle UI.User was stating the the orbs looks very dull, so I decided to add some effects when the orb is lighted on. I added a particle system that is fired when the orb will light and when the user clicks on it to give a visual feedback beside the audio one.

Conclusion


Nest steps
Many features can be added for Puzzler VR to enhance the game play. Some of these features are: 
Having a difficulty game mode where the player could choose from easy, medium and hard where the pattern can be more in size, speed or position, giving a chance for the user to challenge themselves. 
The gate can be animated and closed when the user enters the dungeon.
